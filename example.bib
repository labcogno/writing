@unpublished{Li2017,
abstract = {The link between phonological abilities and the development of skilled reading is well-established in both typical and atypical language development. However, the nature of phonological deficits in low ability readers remains a debated topic. On the one hand, individuals with specific reading impairment have been mostly assumed to have underspecified (or “fuzzy”) phonological representations (Tallal et al., 1998) that highly overlap with each other due to less detailed phonemic representations. On the other hand, an alternative hypothesis has also been proposed: reading difficulty derives from overspecified phonological representations, in which perceiving spoken sounds in allophonic instead of phonemic units results in mismatch between written symbols and spoken sound categories (Serniclaes, 2006). To examine these two hypotheses, we used a visual world eye tracking paradigm closely modeled after one used by Dahan et al. (2001) to investigate individual differences in sensitivity to subphonemic information in young adults with a wide range of reading abilities. Our findings suggest that subphonemic sensitivity is inversely correlated with reading ability, consistent with overspecification. Our comprehensive assessments of individual differences contribute important new knowledge regarding the cognitive profile across a wide spectrum of reading abilities.},
